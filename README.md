# Simple Video Controller

The desire for this project was to create a simple and easily auditable HTML video speed controller.
No longer will you have to worry that the 5,000 line video controller you downloaded is doing something sneaky behind your back.

# How to Download

This is currently more difficult than it should be because I haven't bothered to add this to the Chrome Web Store.

Steps:

1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to chrome://extensions/ in Chrome or whatever the same is in Chromium / Brave
3. Click "Load Unpacked"
4. Click the Chrome folder inside the project you cloned
5. Success!
6. Note to self, make this easier in the future

# Current Functionality

-   Set hotkeys to control video speed
-   Show or hide current video speed (also hotkey-able)
-   Set a persistent speed which will carry through videos (possibly a WIP)
-   Change speed modifier (default 0.1x)
-   Plugin is 486 lines of code, meaning most novice developers should be able to audit it without much trouble

# Future Goals

-   Add Firefox Compatibility
-   Publish on Chrome Web Store
-   Add hotkeys for speed pre-sets
-   Create logo
-   Improve popup menu styling
-   Improve plugin wording

# Inspiration

The hugely popular [Video Speed Controller](https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed) was the inspiration for this project. I'm a big fan of the plugin and had been using it for years before writing this.
